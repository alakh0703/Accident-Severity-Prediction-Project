# Accident Severity Prediction Project - KSI

## Overview
This project centers on the utilization of the KSI (Killed or Seriously Injured) dataset. Through the integration of a predictive model, the system aims to discern the outcomes of accidents, specifically classifying them as fatal or non-fatal incidents. By employing advanced data analysis techniques, our project strives to provide valuable insights into predicting the severity of accidents. This predictive capability has the potential to substantially improve road safety measures and facilitate the development of proactive strategies for accident prevention.

## Features
- Data Exploration and Visualization - Utilizes pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for comprehensive data exploration and visualization.
- Data Preprocessing and Transformation - Employs sklearn and custom functions for efficient data preprocessing and transformation tasks.
- Data Splitting and Scaling - Utilizes `train_test_split` for data partitioning and StandardScaler for feature scaling.
- Model Selection and Evaluation - Implements cross-validation, grid search, and diverse metrics for robust model selection and evaluation.
- Model Comparison and Selection - Utilizes various evaluation tools including confusion matrix, classification report, accuracy score, and ROC curve for model comparison and selection.
- Model Deployment and Persistence - Implements model deployment and persistence using joblib for seamless integration and utilization.
- Frontend Development - Incorporates Flask for backend functionality and HTML/CSS for frontend development, ensuring a user-friendly interface.
